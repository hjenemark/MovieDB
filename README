With this database front-end you can gather all the info for your
collection of movies.

This is meant as an exercise in mySQL and the interaction between
a database and a Java application. It might not be the best way
of storing this kind of information, but it is one way.

Before running the app:
 - Set up a mySQL database with a table called `MovieArchive` with
   the following fields (followed by datatype):
 - - title:	 	varchar(255)
 - - director	varchar(100)
 - - lead		varchar(255)
 - - secondary	text
 - - runtime	int(4)
 - - imdburl	varchar(50)
 - - comments	text
 - Username and password for the database is to be set in the
   DBConstants interface, which has to match your own database.
 
   - and yeah, you'll be needing all the packages imported.

The application is set up in the Eclipse IDE and there might be
some compilation parameters needed that I'm not aware off at this
point, but the source is there to play around with.

Status: 
 - Save Button works
 - Selecting a movie on the list shows its info

To do:
 - Figure out a final button layout
 - a class to make an online search after movie info and parsing
   of the resulting website.
